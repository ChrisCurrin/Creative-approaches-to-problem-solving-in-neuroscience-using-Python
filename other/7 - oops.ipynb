    "Some consider OOP to be an oops because it is easy to be abused (everything becomes a class and is inherited, poluting a bunch of empty parent abstract classed) and can take longer to understand. However, once the code is understood, it *can* be easier to extend the programme. \n",
    "The OOP style is generally preferred for developing *libraries* as they encapsulate a lot of complexity from the user."
